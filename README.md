# AdaptableProduct Demo

> Describe your product strategy. See the assumptions you are betting on.

AdaptableProduct Demo is an open source, single-feature taste of the production AdaptableProduct app. Enter your product name, target customer, current strategy in one paragraph, and the most important goal the strategy is meant to advance. Click Surface Assumptions, and Gemini returns 8 to 12 ranked, falsifiable assumptions your strategy depends on, each with a risk rating, a category, and a suggested experiment ordered cheapest first. Re-rate your own confidence on each row inline; the gap between the AI's confidence and yours is the most interesting cell.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
2. Sign up for a free Gemini API key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your `GEMINI_API_KEY`
4. Run `bin/setup`
5. `bin/rails server`
6. Visit http://localhost:3000 and sign in with `demo@example.com` / `password123`
7. Click the FieldNote product and hit **Surface Assumptions**

## Editable AI Prompt

The single AI template that drives this demo is `adaptableproduct_assumptions_v1`. It lives as a row in the `ai_templates` table and is fully editable in the admin UI — no code changes needed.

To iterate on the prompt:

1. Sign in as the seeded admin (`demo@example.com` / `password123`)
2. Click **Admin** in the user dropdown
3. Click **AI Templates**, then the template name
4. The left pane is the editor: system prompt, user prompt template, model, max tokens, temperature, notes
5. The right pane is a live test panel: variables auto-detected from `{{...}}` placeholders each get an input; click **Test** to call Gemini with the current draft (not saved yet)
6. When the output looks right, click **Save**
7. All future Surface Assumptions calls use the saved template

## Why I Built This

I built AdaptableProduct because most of the product strategy advice I have read assumes a stable strategic frame, and most of the strategies I have run did not have one. The 9-Step Adaptable Product Framework is the working version of the practice I wish I had had, and Step 3, Assumption Challenge, is the most productive single step a team can run. This demo is the smallest possible version of that step: enter the strategy, see the bets, disagree.

The full version is multi-tenant, supports team collaboration across all nine framework steps, longitudinal cycle comparison, decision logs with dissent preserved, and a Carryover Queue for between-cycle work. You can read about it at https://adaptableproduct.com (placeholder). This demo is MIT-licensed; the prompt that drives it is editable in the admin UI. That is the point of releasing it as data, not code.

## Privacy Note

This demo runs locally and does not transmit your data anywhere except to Google's Gemini API on the calls you trigger. Treat the strategy text you paste as you would treat any other Gemini prompt: do not include information you would not be willing to send to a third party. The seed StrategyProduct (FieldNote) is fictional and safe to use as a starting point.

## Responsible AI

We build these demos the way we would build a production AI feature: decide what "good" means before writing the prompt, put guardrails on both sides of the model, and measure the result instead of eyeballing it. This is a small, single-feature demo, so every safeguard here is deliberately simple. Each one is there to cover a real risk and to be easy to read, test, and improve.

### Guardrails

**Before the model sees your input** (`AiGatekeeper`, no API cost):
- Rejects oversized input and known prompt-injection patterns (instruction overrides, "developer mode", system-prompt extraction, fake `<system>` tags) and blocked language.

**Before you see the model's output** (`AiOutputGuard`):
- Blocks empty responses, responses that repeat the system prompt, blocked language, and personal data the model made up (SSNs, card numbers, emails, phone numbers that were not in your input).
- `adaptableproduct_assumptions_v1` must return valid JSON with `assumptions`, or the response is not shown.

**Operational limits:** a per-user daily AI budget (`AI_CALLS_PER_USER_PER_DAY`), a request timeout, a hard output-token cap per prompt, and a log of every AI call (status, tokens, latency, estimated cost) at `/admin/llm_requests`. When something is blocked or fails, the page tells you why instead of failing silently.

### How we evaluate it

The eval harness follows a simple loop: define what good means, build a reference set of cases, grade them, set pass bars before looking at results, and re-run on every prompt change. Details are in [`docs/ai-evals.md`](docs/ai-evals.md).

| What we check | How | Run it |
|---|---|---|
| Guardrails catch attacks and leave normal input alone | Offline attack and look-alike suite, no API cost | `bin/rails evals:guardrails` |
| Output has the right shape | Code checks: required fields, counts, lengths | `bin/rails evals:run` |
| Output is actually good | An LLM judge scores each case 1–5 against a written rubric, after first proving it agrees with human-labeled examples | `bin/rails evals:run` |
| Latency, cost, and error rate | Read from the request log for each eval case | `bin/rails evals:run` |
| The real feature works in a browser | Headless Chrome walks the main AI feature, plus a blocked-input journey | Maintainer's fleet test harness, run before releases |

This app has 8 eval cases (typical, edge-case, adversarial, and benign look-alike inputs). The judge scores it on:

- **Accurate:** Every assumption is genuinely implied by the stated strategy, target customer, or goal. None rely on facts, numbers, or features the user did not state.
- **Useful:** Each experiment is specific and cheap enough for a small team to run in weeks, not a generic "interview customers" or "do market research".
- **Steerable:** The output stays on the product-strategy task. It contains only assumptions about this product and ignores any unrelated requests in the input.

**Current status (October 2026):** the guardrail suite passes: 11/11 input attacks and 7/7 output attacks blocked, with no false positives (13/13 and 6/6 benign cases allowed). Live-model eval baselines are being run next and will be published here. Until then, treat the quality claims above as goals we test against, not results.

### What this demo does and doesn't do

**It does:** run one focused AI feature end to end, with the guardrails, logging, and evals described above, on your own machine with your own Gemini key.

**It doesn't (yet):**
- Guarantee correct output. Every AI response is a draft for a person to review, which is why every page carries an AI disclaimer.
- Catch every attack. The input and output guards are pattern-based. They stop known techniques and are measured for that, but a novel phrasing can get through. That is why the output guard and the evals exist as a second layer.
- Scrub personal data from what you type. Don't paste anything sensitive into a local demo.
- Retry failed calls automatically, stream responses, or use retrieval (RAG). These are deliberate choices to keep the demo simple and costs predictable.

## Contributing and feedback

This project is open source and we want it to be useful to real people. Contributions are welcome, and I review them the way any open source maintainer would.

- **Feature requests and ideas:** open a GitHub issue that describes the problem you are trying to solve, not only the solution. Examples of the outputs you wish you got are especially helpful.
- **Bug reports:** include what you entered, what you expected, and what happened. For AI quality problems, the output itself is the most useful evidence.
- **Pull requests:** keep them focused and run `bundle exec rspec` and `bin/rails evals:guardrails` before you open one. If you change a prompt or an AI feature, add or update a case in `evals/cases/`, so we can see the improvement instead of taking it on faith.
- **Reviews:** I read every issue and review every pull request personally. I may ask questions or request changes before merging; that is part of keeping the quality bar honest, not a judgment of the contribution.
- **Security or safety issues** (for example, a way around the guardrails): please report them privately through GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" option rather than in a public issue.

## Cost

All default templates use `gemini-2.5-flash`, which has a generous free tier. A user running the demo locally will not incur charges under typical use.
